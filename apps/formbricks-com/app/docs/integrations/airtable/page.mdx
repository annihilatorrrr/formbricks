#### Integrations

# Airtable

The Airtable integration allows you to automatically send responses to a Airtable of your choice.

<Note>
  This feature is enabled by default in Formbricks Cloud but needs to be self-configured when running a
  self-hosted version of Formbricks.
</Note>

## Formbricks Cloud

1. Go to the Integrations tab in your [Formbricks Cloud dashboard](https://app.formbricks.com/) and click on the "Connect" button under Airtable integration.

3. You will now be taken to a where you need to add and grant access to the base you want to use for the integration.

/>

4. Once you add and grant access to your base, you will be taken back to Formbricks Cloud and see the connected status as below:

  alt="Formbricks is now connected with Google"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

<Note>

Before the next step, make sure that you have a Formbricks Survey with at least one question and a Airtable base with atleast one table in the Airtable account you integrated.

</Note>

6. Now click on the "Link New Table" button to link a new Airtable with Formbricks and a modal will open up.

  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

7. Select the Base and table you want to link with Formbricks and the Survey. On doing so, you will be asked with what questions' responses you want to feed in Airtable. Select the questions and click on the "Save" button.

<Image
  src={LinkWithQuestions}
  alt="Select question to link with Airtable"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"

/>

8. On submitting, the modal will close and you will see the linked table in the list of linked tables.

  src={ListLinkedSurveys}
  alt="List of linked tables"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Congratulations! You have successfully linked a Airtable with Formbricks. Now whenever a response is submitted for the linked Survey, it will be automatically added to the linked Airtable.
